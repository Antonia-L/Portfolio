            <p>Everyone once dreamed about who they want to be.  For me, I want to be an engineer.  I have decided that I want to be an aerospace engineer or a civil engineer.  I am going to achieve this goal by choosing different engineering classes provided by the school, and research about engineering in my free time.<br>I am very determined and patient.  I do not give up easily.  I would keep trying until I success or until I am certain that I cannot accomplish what I was trying to accomplish at that time, but I will go back to continue it once I know I can do it.   I also have good memory, I can remember most of the things after I did it first time, so I can remember most of the codes for programming.  My extracurricular activity is playing the piano.  I have several achievements in piano.  I passed the ABRSM Exam for level 8 piano with distinction.  I enjoy playing jigsaw puzzles as well.  That is how I train myself to be patient.  From all the things I did, I learned that in order to success, I need to think things through, and then try it.  If I fail, then I need to know where I did it wrong, so I can correct it from there.<br>This is all the things you need to know about me.  Thank you for taking your time reading this.  I hope you enjoy the rest of the website.</p>
