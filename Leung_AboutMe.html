            <p>Everyone once dreamed about who they want to be.  For me, I want 
            to be an engineer.  I have decided that I want to be an aerospace 
            engineer.  I am going to achieve this goal by taking
            engineering classes provided by my school.  So far I have 
            taken Computer Science/Software Engineering, Honors Principle of 
            Engineering and am taking Honors Digital Electronics.  I learned how 
            to program in various programming languages, the basics of different 
            engineering aspects, and have gained some in depth knowledge 
            about electrical engineering.<br><br>I am a junior from Dublin High School.  I am a very determined 
            and patient person.  I do not give up easily.  I would keep trying until I 
            success or until I am certain that I cannot accomplish what I was 
            trying to accomplish at that time, but I will go back to continue it 
            once I know I can do it.   I also have good memory, I can remember 
            most of the things after I did it first time.  My hobby is 
            playing the piano.  I have several achievements in piano.  I passed 
            the ABRSM Exam for level 8 piano with distinction.  I enjoy playing 
            jigsaw puzzles as well.  That is how I train myself to be patient.  
            From all the things I did, I learned that in order to success, I 
            need to think things through, and then try it.  If I fail, then I 
            need to know where I did it wrong, so I can correct it from there.
            <br>Thank you for taking your time reading this.  I hope you enjoy the rest of the 
            website.</p>
