            <p>This is a project created by my partner, Brandon Lau, and I using
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> in 
            Computing Science/Engineering class.  We worked on the project 
            between 29 August, 2017 and 8 September, 2017.  We created a story 
            named <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172824049/" 
            target="_blank">"Road Trip Story"</a> for this project.  The objective 
            of the story is to help Bear, the main character in the story, to 
            make decisions in his road trip.  I created some of the plots in the
            story, and I coded for most of the story.  When I was doing the 
            project, I learned how to code to make the sprite does certain 
            things.  I also learned how to use variables.  One of the challenges 
            I had when coding for the project is the events goes in loops.  I 
            solved the problem by using different ways to code that will reach 
            the same result.</p>

            The objective of the project is to create a hangman game.  When the

            word.  My partner and I collaborated well throughout the project.  
            We made decisions after each other agreed.  In this project, I 
            learned how to code in Python.  I overcome obstacles by searching 
            online, and see what other people did for similar problems.</p>

            16 October, 2018 and 22 October, 2018.   The objective of the project 
            is to create a winch system that can lift items that are at least 
            100 grams up for at least 30 centimeters.  The user can use a switch
            to turn on the motor, and the motor will power the wheel, which will
            then lift up the object if the object is attached to the rope
            connected to the wheel.  In this project, I came up with the general 
            idea of how we should make our winch system, and I built the base of 
            the system.  Also, I learned how to use a swtich to control the 
            on/off of a circuit.  Some challenges are mounting the motor and 
            keeping the rope on the wheel.  My group overcame those problems by 
            looking around the classroom and see what we can use to solve the 
            problems.</p>

            We worked on this project between 07 March, 2019 and 18 March, 2019.   
            The objective of the project 
            is to create a bridge that meets the West Point Bridge Design 
            Constraints and costs less than 300, 000.  To see how the bridge 
            performs, the user just need to run it and it will show the amount 
            of tension and compression each member of the bridge is under.  In 
            this project, I came up with the idea of the primary design of the 
            bridge.  Later, I improvised the design with my partner.  I learned 
            how to build a stable bridge and how different materials perform 
            under the two types of stress.  Some challenges are designing a
            bridge that fits under the budget and is stable enough.  I overcame 
            those problems by looking at the results of different trials, and
            trying out new ideas that could work.</p>

            between 07 October, 2019 and 25 October, 2019.   The objective of the 
            project is to create a printed circuit board by going through the steps 
            in the design process, and the process of making a copper board into a 
            circuit board. In this project, I found a electronic piano schematic 
            online, and I prototyped my circuit according to that website.  After I 
            finish prototyping, I tested the circuit before I used Fritzing for 
            designing the PCB layout.  After that, I did masking and etching so the 
            mask will stay on the board.  To finish,  I drilled holes and soldered the
            components onto the board.  Some challenges I encountered were not able
            to find a circuit that I can build, and not having time for redo if I 
            made a mistake.  To solve this, I spent extra time outside of class to 
            search and try different circuits.  I also did every steps carefully so 
            I wouldn't make mistake.  In this project, I learned the process of PCB 
            Design, and how to manage my time better.</p>
