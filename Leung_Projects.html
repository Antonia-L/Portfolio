            <p>This is a project created by my partner, Brandon Lau, and I using
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> in 
            Computing Science/Engineering class.  We worked on the project 
            between August 29, 2017 and September 8, 2017.  We created a story 
            named <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172824049/" 
            target="_blank">"Road Trip Story"</a> for this project.  The objective 
            of the story is to help Bear, the main character in the story, to 
            make decisions in his road trip.  I created some of the plots in the
            story, and I coded for most of the story.  When I was doing the 
            project, I learned how to code to make the sprite does certain 
            things.  I also learned how to use variables.  One of the challenges 
            I had when coding for the project is the events goes in loops.  I 
            solved the problem by using different ways to code that will reach 
            the same result.</p>

            <p>This is a project created by my partner, Sanika Kulkarni and I.
            We worked on this project between January 24, 2018 and February 1, 
            2018.  This project is for my Computer Science/Engineering class.  
            The objective of the project is to create a hangman game.  When the 
            user input a letter, the code will check the letter to the secret 
            word.  My partner and I collaborated well throughout the project.  
            We made decisions after each other agreed.  In this project, I 
            learned how to code in Python.  I overcome obstacles by searching 
            online, and see what other people did for similar problems.</p>
