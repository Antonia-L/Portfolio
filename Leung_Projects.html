            <p>This is a project created by my partner, Brandon Lau, and I using
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> in 
            Computing Science/Engineering class.  We worked on the project 
            between 29 August, 2017 and 8 September, 2017.  We created a story 
            named <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172824049/" 
            target="_blank">"Road Trip Story"</a> for this project.  The objective 
            of the story is to help Bear, the main character in the story, to 
            make decisions in his road trip.  I created some of the plots in the
            story, and I coded for most of the story.  When I was doing the 
            project, I learned how to code to make the sprite does certain 
            things.  I also learned how to use variables.  One of the challenges 
            I had when coding for the project is the events goes in loops.  I 
            solved the problem by using different ways to code that will reach 
            the same result.</p>

            We worked on this project between 24 January, 2018 and 1 February, 
            2018.  This project is for my Computer Science/Engineering class.  
            The objective of the project is to create a hangman game.  When the 
            user input a letter, the code will check the letter to the secret 
            word.  My partner and I collaborated well throughout the project.  
            We made decisions after each other agreed.  In this project, I 
            learned how to code in Python.  I overcome obstacles by searching 
            online, and see what other people did for similar problems.</p>

            <p>This is a project created by my classmates, Jack LeValley, 
            Khalil Pyles, Samiksha Yelthimar and I in the Principles of 
            Engineering class.  The project is named <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18onALXSAgw9r1H2aX_zAoIUQiK099YK3-F87F3VPSvY/edit" target="_blank">The Wondrous Winch</a>.  We worked on this project between 
            16 October, 2018 and 22 October, 2018.   The objective of the project 
            is to create a winch system that can lift items that are at least 
            100 grams up for at least 30 centimeters.  The user can use a switch
            to turn on the motor, and the motor will power the wheel, which will
            then lift up the object if the object is attached to the rope
            connected to the wheel.  In this project, I came up with the general 
            idea of how we should make our winch system, and I built the base of 
            the system.  Also, I learned how to use a swtich to control the 
            on/off of a circuit.  Some challenges are mounting the motor and 
            keeping the rope on the wheel.  My group overcame those problems by 
            looking around the classroom and see what we can use to solve the 
            problems.</p>
