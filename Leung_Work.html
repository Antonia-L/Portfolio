        <h2>Influential Guest Speakers and Field Trips</h2>
        <h3>Guest Speaker: Jonathan Botkin</h3>
        <p>There were many guest speakers who had came to speak to the academy
        students, but the most memorable one for me is Mr. Jonathan Botkin.
        Mr. Botkin works for a solar energy company.  He explained how solar
        cells work and he introduced some interesting engineering books.
        He also suggested students to get a job they like because it is easier
        to work with something you are interested in.<br>After Mr. Botkin's
        presentation, I learned more in depth about solar cells.  It is useful
        for me because solar energy is becoming more popular and it is an
        inexhaustible energy.  I also found out what books I should read
        that's about engineering.  Mr. Botkins presentation also verified my
        thought that I should choose a job I like.</p>
        <h3>Guest Speaker: Jason Yosinski</h3>
        <p>Another guest speaker I had in my class was Mr. Jason Yosinski, he
            talked about machine learning with us.  After his presentation, I 
            learned how machines learn from their mistakes.  This process improved 
            over the last 10 years because of neronetwork, and it is an important 
            process for artificial intelligents.<br>These are important knowledge 
            for me because machine learning is getting more popular and it will 
            be the direction the technology industry is going.</p>
        <h3>Field Trip: Patriot Jet Team Foundation</h3>
        <p>On 6 December, 2018, I went to the Patriot Jet Team Foundation on a 
        field trip with other academy students.  Patriot Jet Team Foundation
        hangar has a variety of different planes, and has plane simulators.
        During the trip, I learned about different features of a plane, I learned
        about emerging technologies in aerospace engineering, and I learned the
        ratio of the distance between the planets.<br>That field trip
        has taught me a lot about planes and how they function.  Those are
        important information for me because my goal is to be an aerospace
        engineer.  By learning about the principles of how a plane works, I can 
        now know how to improve the design of a plane.</p>
        <h3>Field Trip: GoFly Event</h3>
        <p>On 29 February, 2020, I went to the GoFly Event.  In that event, when 
            I was looking at different designs for the flying machines, I noticed 
            that they come in different shapes and sizes.  They also used different 
            amounts of propellers.  One of my favourite ones is the one that shaped 
            like a telephone booth.  After looking at all of these designs, I realized 
            that there are many different creative ways to approach a problem since I 
            was expecting the final designs would all look like a miniplane more or less. </p>

        <h2>Mentorship Program</h2>
        <p>I participated in the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy mentorship 
            program.  My mentor is Ms. Judy Zavadil.  She is a civil engineer.  
            During the meetings I had with her, she helped me a lot on getting ready 
            for colleges.  She helped me to make my resume more professional and more 
            detailed.  SHe also gave me useful feedbacks in the mock interviews so I 
            can improve upon them.  She also encouraged me to talk more to other mentors 
            to see what I can learn from them so I can be better.  I am thankful for her 
            taking her time off to meet with me.</p>
