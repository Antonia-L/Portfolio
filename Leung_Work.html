        <h2>Work/Volunteer Experience</h2>
        <p>The following are my volunteering experiences.  
        I don't have any work experience yet but I plan on applying for 
        internships during this summer to gain work experience.  Here is my <a href ="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgxmt5iBemQn-Y8ZvmZaWOyl2e9gVgUM/view" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>

        <h2>Influential Guest Speakers and Field Trips</h2>
        <h3>Guest Speaker: Jonathan Botkin</h3>
        <p>There were many guest speakers who had came to speak to the academy
        students, but the most memorable one for me is Mr. Jonathan Botkin.
        Mr. Botkin works for a solar energy company.  He explained how solar
        cells work and he introduced some interesting engineering books.
        He also suggested students to get a job they like because it is easier
        to work with something you are interested in.<br>After Mr. Botkin's
        presentation, I learned more in depth about solar cells.  It is useful
        for me because solar energy is becoming more popular and it is an
        inexhaustible energy.  I also found out what books I should read
        that's about engineering.  Mr. Botkins presentation also verified my
        thought that I should choose a job I like.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Field Trip: Patriot Jet Team Foundation</h3>
        <p>On 6 December, 2018, I went to the Patriot Jet Team Foundation on a 
        field trip with other academy students.  Patriot Jet Team Foundation
        hangar has a variety of different planes, and has plane simulators.
        During the trip, I learned about different features of a plane, I learned
        about emerging technologies in aerospace engineering, and I learned the
        ratio of the distance between the planets.<br>That field trip
        has taught me a lot about planes and how they function.  Those are
        important information for me because my goal is to be an aerospace
        engineer.  By learning about the principles of how a plane works, I can 
        now know how to improve the design of a plane.</p>
